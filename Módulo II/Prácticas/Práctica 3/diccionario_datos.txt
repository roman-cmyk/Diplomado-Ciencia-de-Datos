Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset
--------------------------------------------

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
        worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
        resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
        10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.

        - class:
                - WDBC-Malignant
                - WDBC-Benign
